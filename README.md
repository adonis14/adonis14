# Hi, I'm Adonis 👋  
**Full Stack Developer | PHP • Python • Go • TypeScript • Angular • React • Cloud & Automation**

## 👨‍💻 My Story
I started coding not because I planned a career in tech, but because I genuinely enjoy creating things that solve real problems. Over the years, this simple curiosity evolved into a passion for building reliable systems, clean architectures, and meaningful digital experiences.

I've worked across different industries — healthcare, e-commerce, film distribution, event platforms — and each one taught me something new about how technology connects people. I love the feeling of taking a complex idea, breaking it into simple parts, and turning it into something real that others can use.

What drives me now is improvement — writing cleaner code, learning smarter patterns, understanding systems more deeply, and becoming the kind of engineer who can be trusted with anything from frontend design to backend architecture.

My goals are simple:
- Keep building projects that push my limits  
- Learn continuously and stay curious  
- Contribute to open-source and collaborate with great engineers  
- Grow into a lead engineer who builds not just software, but strong engineering culture
